                                <p>Grid allow a 2 or 3 dimensional layout of
                                    website.
                                    This involves setting main div display to grid.
                                    e.g .main {
                                        display: grid;
                                        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
                                        grid-template-rows: 100px 150px 150px
                                        gap: 20px
                                    }
    
                                    .first {
                                        grid-column: span 2;
                                    }
    
                                    .card {
                                        background-color: red;
                                    }
                                    which simply means, create 2-columns and 3-rows, <br>
                                    make the first div occupy two columns. So the first <br>
                                    div will occupy two columns and will be 100px. The rest <br>
                                    will occupy one column and will be 150px each with a gap <br>
                                    of 20px.
                                </p>
                            </ul>

                        <li>Flexbox
                            <ul>
                                <p>Flex allow 1 dimensional layout of website. 
                                    .container {
                                        display: flex;

                                    .card {
                                        background: brown;
                                        border: 20px solid seagreen;
                                        height: 150px;
                                        flex: 1
                                    }
    
                                    .first {
                                        flex 2
                                    }
    
                                    .second {
                                        flex: 0.5;
                                    }
                                    This simply means: We set the main div display to flex
                                    then we add border, we set each div to brown then its border
                                    to seagreen, we set the height and we make it to 1 ratio.
                                    we set first div to be twice the size of default which is 1.
                                    we set second div to be half of the default div. So with the
                                    ratio as width, it makes it responsive.

                                    screen is divided to 12 unit. So with our example, col-6 means
                                    occupy 6 unit each in the 12 units sections. col-4 and col-2 
                                    and so on.

                            <ul>
                                <p>Previously, we discuss about max-width.
                                    In media query, we also have min-width.
                                    for example: <br>
                                    <li>@media(min-width:720px){ <br>
                                        h1 {font-size: 2rem} <br>
                                        } <br>
                                    </li>
                                    This means, when the screen size is at 720px, <br>
                                    that is minimum of 720px and above. Increase the <br>
                                    font size. This target bigger screen. <br>
                                </p>
                                <h5 style="margin: 0px;">Combining Breakpoint.</h5>
                                <p>We can combine breakpoint to target specific size eg: <br>
                                    <li>@media(min-width:720px) and (max-width: 900px){ <br>
                                        ... <br>
                                        } <br>
                                    </li>
                                    This means, we want the effect on screen of range between <br>
                                    720px and 900px. So anything bigger than 720px and less <br>
                                    than 900px. <br>
                                </p>
                                <p><li>
                                    media(max-width:720px) and (min-width: 900px){ <br>
                                        ... <br>
                                        } <br>
                                </li>
                                Flipping it around make the interpretation to change. This <br>
                                means, we want changes below 720px on small screen and on <br>
                                bigger screen should be greater than 900px and higher. <br>
                            </p>

                            <p>We can also see device usage. eg <br> <li>
                                @media screen(orientation: landscape) { <br>
                                    .... <br>
                                } <br>
                            </li>
                            We don't have to put 'screen' as it'll be applicable to all screen by default. <br>
                            Alternative to screen is print. This allow us to use media query to <br>
                            target only when our website is printed and to give it different layout. <br>
                            so we can either target screen or print and we don't have to be explicit <br>
                            by writing both the screen and the print out. <br>
                        </p>

                <h3><li>Flex(One dimensional layout)</h3>
                    <p>This is easy and neat modern tools. Which is simply
                        implemented by creating a div that encapsulate the
                        rest div's. Simple illustration is:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        .container {
                            display: flex;
                            gap: 10px;
                          }
                      
                          p {
                            background-color: darkseagreen;
                          }
                    </ul>
                    <p>Previously, we learned that div occupy full width while
                        span is an inline element. p tag is also block element.
                        img tag is an inline but with flexbox, all of the default
                        behavior are overlook. And the width of each of these element
                        inside flexbox will be based on the content size. So it'll 
                        try and let us have all our content on one line. We can then use
                        Gap property to separate them. Default setting of a container(div)
                        is like a block element(100% full width). We can also set it as:
                        'inline-flex'. Which is similar to the inline we already treated. 
                        It'll make flexbox occupy the space needed. Which means other things
                        can also go and occupy in that same line. So we can either set the
                        main container(div) as either 'flex' or 'inline-flex'.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style:circle;">Flex direction
                            <ul>
                                <p>The default settings of flex is row. We can also set
                                    flex direction property to 'column.' When at default
                                    that is 'row'. the main axis tends to be on an horizontal
                                    line while the cross-axis will be on vertical line.
                                    Which when 'flex-basis' property is apply, it
                                    increases the width. If the flex-direction is set to
                                    'column' the main axis will now be vertical and the 
                                    cross-axis will now be the horizontal line. Which means
                                    when 'flex-basis' property is apply, it will increase the
                                    height.

                                </li>
                                <p>In the above example, since the 'flex-direction' is 
                                    column, flex-basis will increase the height of each 
                                    items. If it is at default of row. The width will 
                                    increase instead. We used 'inline-flex' to make the
                                    full-width not at default of block instead it should 
                                    take the width of the content.
                                </p>

                            <p>Align, justify and wrap. Note: you have to differentiate
                                whether properties is from parent(container) or the child
                                (flex-items). For example, 'order' can only be set on the 
                                flex-items. Default order of html element is '0'.
                                Also, we have 'flex-wrap' which is applicable to the parent 
                                (container). The default is 'nowrap' which makes our container
                                not responsive as it'll cut-off some items. Which we can set to 
                                'wrap' which make our items continue to other line when the first 
                                line can't contain them. For Demonstration click =>

                                            This is useful when we run out of space on the 
                                            horizontal. The default settings is set to 'nowrap'.
                                            Which we can set to 'wrap', which move all element 
                                            that the first line can't contain onto the next line.
                                            We also have 'wrap-reverse' which make things wrap from
                                            bottom right to the top left corner. Instead of the 
                                            normal version which is from top left to bottom right.

                                    <p>This sets the distribution of our items along main-axis.
                                       Properties are: 'flex-start', 'flex-end', 'space-evenly',
                                       'space-around', 'space-between' and 'center'.

                                        <p>
                                            This is similar to 'align-items but only works with 'wrap'. 
                                            When we set our items to wrap and we want to specify how the 
                                            content should align, then 'align-content' comes to play. For 
                                            example, if we applied 'align-content' to center and we made 
                                            our flexbox wrap, then when the width of our window reduces 
                                            everything will be muzzle up together. If second line is needed
                                            they'll go to the second line and then it'll look the 'align-content'
                                            value to see how it should be space on the screen. When items is 
                                            'nowrap' and we set the 'align-content', it doesn't really do anything.
                                            But when we set items to 'wrap', and then there is not enough width to
                                            have everything on one line, that's when our 'align-content' comes into 
                                            action. Properties are: 'baseline', 'flex-start', 'flex-end', 'stretch'
                                            and 'center'.

                                            Unlike the 'justify-content' which is applicable along 
                                            horizontal axis. 'align-items' distribute across 'cross
                                            axis'. For this properties to work, we have to set its 
                                            height. eg: height: 50vh; That is the 'viewport height'.

                                            'stretch' and 'center'. If wrap was enable, the behavior
                                            will be cringe which we'll expatiate when we discuss 'align

                    <ul>
                        <p>Flexbox has default behavior to adjust to content size but 
                            here we'll dive into full way to customize the behavior to 
                            our taste. In flexbox, we have a priority list which is range 
                            from 'content-width < width < flex-basis < max-width/min-width'
                            It first look at whether max-width/min-width is set, then flex-basis,
                            width, and finally the content-width. 'content-width' allows content 
                            to lie up next to each other. If shrink, it'll reduce to 'minimum-width'
                            which is where the text wraps and they are stacked on top each other. 
                            The default behavior of flexbox is to shrink until it reach the minimum
                            content size. The longest word determine the final size. On getting to the 
                            minimum width, all of the content start disappearing as shrinking continues.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Priorities:
                            <ol>
                                <li value="5">content-width
                                    <ul>
                                        <p>This is the default behavior of container which makes 
                                            content fit the entire line.
                                        </p>
                                    </ul>

                                <li value="4">width
                                    <ul>
                                        <p>If we set width, each item will conform with 
                                            the set width. Assume we set width to 100px. 
                                            on 4 items. When the container shrunk, it'll 
                                            respect the set width until there is not enough 
                                            overall width of the container. Which is 400px 
                                            considering our example here. So if the container 
                                            width get lesser than 400px, it'll adjust to the 
                                            minimum-size of the content(longest words). It'll 
                                            respect our set width when there is enough space 
                                            for the container otherwise it'll adjust dynamically
                                            until minimum width of each item  is attain. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Note: At default, if we had nothing set on the container
                                            it'll look at the entire line when it's all on one line.
                                            Which will be the 'content-width' but if width is set 
                                            it'll adjust to the width instead of the content-width.
                                            So, 'width' will be obey till will shrunk the container.
                                            Where it no longer fit everything as set width, then it
                                            starts shrinking the box.

                                        <p>This increase 'width' when container is at default(rows)
                                            But increase 'height' when 'flex-direction' is at column.
                                            'flex-basis' overshadow' 'width' when both are set on an 
                                            items. It'll adjust to set value of 'flex-basis' as long 
                                            as there is enough room in the container, But as soon as 
                                            we shrink the container down, just as before, it'll adjust 
                                            to the 'minimum-width'
                                        </p>

                                        <p>This looks at longest words to determine the minimum-width. Which
                                            determine how small each items can shrink to. For example, if 
                                            'flex-basis' is 200px and 'min-width' is 300px, the items will 
                                            respect the 'min-width' instead of the 'flex-basis'. 'min-width'
                                            overshadow 'flex-basis' when it's larger than 'flex-basis'. Items 
                                            does not shrink beyond 'min-width' size.
                                         </p>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li value="1">max-width
                                    <ul>
                                        <p>This looks at longest possible line of the text. So it's all of 
                                            content lined up in one line. We can customize this, for example, 
                                            if we set 'max-width' to 100px and our flex-basis is 200px.
                                            'max-width' will overpower the flex-basis property because it's 
                                            lower than the 'flex-basis'. 'max-width' is the maximum requirement
                                            for the items to grow. But if 'flex-basis' is smaller, it'll ignore 
                                            the 'max-width'.

                                                    it, then it'll adjust to the 'content-width'
                                                </p>
                                            </ul>

                                            <ul>
                                                <p>Switching on both means it'll take much width as possible 
                                                    and when shrink, it'll be as small as possible. Which 
                                                    'flex-basis' is completely ignored. So here:
                                                    'flex-grow' represent 'max-width while'
                                                    'flex-shrink' represent 'min-width'. If these two are not 
                                                    set, it'll adjust to the content of those items.  
                                                </p>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            flex-basis: auto; flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1
                                            <ul>
                                                <p>The default of 'flex-basis' is 'auto'. Which look at amount 
                                                    of content in each items, it'll gives more 'flex-basis' to 
                                                    the items with more content. And it'll give less width to
                                                    the one with smaller content. If we want that to be equal
                                                    width, we simply set it 'flex-basis' to '0'

                <h3><li>Grid(Two-dimensional layout)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <p>Grid is more suitable to create complex web layout. 
                            'Flexbox' is best to align content along one dimensional 
                            line. So either 'x or y' axis. While 'Grid' is good to
                            align content alone a two dimensional layout. So both 
                            'x and y' axis. Both flexbox and grid can be mix together.
                            We can as well create one dimensional Grid. But it behave
                            differently. Grid behavior tends to line up on each Other
                            on a column and row basis and the gap between items match.
                            Whereas, flexbox act differently because it's flexible and 
                            tries to adapt and squish content so that everything is place 
                            on screen. So depending on the behavior we seek, whether to 
                            prioritize spacing out content and aligning them or we want 
                            everything to be boxy like a grid.

                                                   gap: 10px
                                                 }
                            This simply means. Create two columns with one column as 
                            fraction of size of 1 and the other column twice the size.
                            Then create 2 rows with both 1 fraction of size with 10px 
                            of space.
                            Note: Default behavior of grid is to take as much full width, 
                            but only has as much height as it allows to fit the content.

                            e.g 'fixed-size': which is not responsive to screen size.

                                    display: grid;
                                    grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
                                    grid-template-columns: 400px 800px;
                                    }
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In this instance, we define rows and columns by giving them 
                                    fixed sizes(px). So we have 2 by 2. Two rows of 100px high for 
                                    the first row, 200px high for the second row.
                                    Two columns of 400px wide for the first one and 800px wide for 
                                    the second column.
                                    Fixed-size grid are not responsive. That means that if we go
                                    ahead and change the width or height, it's not going to change 
                                    at all. It's going to stay fixed to the specified size we set
                                    above. In addition to 'px', we can also use 'Rem' Which is still 
                                    fixed because 'rem' is relative to the root of our html. If our 
                                    body/html has a size specified and we change that size then the
                                    'rem' size will go up and down with it. But this does not make it 
                                    responsive to the screen size.
                                    Instead of specifying grid-template rows and grid-template columns 
                                    we can shorten it to "grid-template: 100px 200px / 400px 800px". 
                                    Rows comes first, then column follows.

                        </li>
                        <li>Auto-Size
                            <ul>
                                <p>
                                    We can also use 'auto' => .grid-container {
                                        display: grid;
                                        grid-template-rows: 100px auto;
                                        grid-template-columns: 200px auto;
                                    }
                                    Unlike before 'Auto' now add a bit of responsiveness. Each row will 
                                    try to fit to 100% of the horizontal available space. In our case now 
                                    we'll have a first 'column' as '200px' then the other one which is auto 
                                    will cover the rest space available width. 'Rows' behave differently, it 
                                    doesn't try to take 100% height. Instead, it tries to fit the content. In 
                                    our case, first row is 100px, the second row which is auto will try to fit 
                                    the content. 
                                </p>

                                <p>This is achieve using ratio(fr) to define layout for sizes eg:
                                    .grid-container {
                                        display: grid;
                                        grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr;
                                        grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
                                    }
                                </p>
                                <p>The above illustration depict that the first row is 1fr and the 
                                    second row is twice the size of the first row. Same logic for
                                    column. This will grow and as well shrink depending on the width
                                    available for the horizontal and also the content size available 
                                    for the vertical. This is responsive type as it always maintain
                                    the figure size provided. Even if we add additional contents, it'll 
                                    expand and still keep the size uniform to the provided figure ratio.

                                    with first condition applicable to when the screen has little space 
                                    we infer 400px as minimum display and 800px wide when the screen has 
                                    enough space. This set a limit. Because sometimes, we have some kind 
                                    of contents that we don't want to be too narrow or too wide. So our 
                                    grid now range from 400px to 800px. So a stop at 400px and stop at 800px 
                                    for responsiveness strain.

                                        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 100px);
                                    }
                                </p>
                                <p>This simply denote that we want two 200px rows. And two 100px column.
                                    Which is same as defining rows as '200px, 200px'. And column as 
                                    '100px, 100px'.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What if we define grid than amount of div's we have? for example, we 
                                    have 4 items or div's and we define 2 by 3 grid. So two rows and three 
                                    columns. If we only have 4 items, they're fitted into our grid from the 
                                    top left to the bottom right. So that means once we've laid out the first 
                                    row, it'll double back and continue along the second row. But if we don't
                                    have any items for number five and six, then it won't add them.
                                    .grid-container {
                                        display: grid;
                                        grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 200px);
                                        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px);
                                    }
                                </p>
                                <p>what if we don't define enough rows and columns? for example:
                                    .grid-container {
                                        display: grid;
                                        grid-template-rows: 200px 200px;
                                        grid-template-columns: 200px 200px;
                                    }
                                    In this case, we have 2 by 2 grid system with each item being 200px 
                                    tall and wide. If we have items/div's of five number which won't fit 
                                    our template, the fifth items  when added we automatically be assign 
                                    with size based on its height and also any existing column sizes. So 
                                    it'll try to meet existing column width and we try to fit to the height 
                                    of the content.
                                </p>
                                <p>We can tweak the extra div to our likening. eg:
                                    .grid-container {
                                        display: grid;
                                        grid-template-rows: 200px 200px;
                                        grid-template-columns: 200px 200px;
                                        grid-auto-rows: 300px
                                    }
                                    So we basically said any more div that's not accounted for in our template 
                                    should have 300px in height. We also have 'grid-auto-columns'. So with this 
                                    logic, we are able to control our styling no matter the amount of div's added
                                    to the grid.

                                <p>When display is at grid, there is a chip that shows 'grid'

                                <p>This separate our tracks. We have horizontal lines and vertical 
                                    lines, these is known as the grid lines. We can only control
                                    the grid lines by using the gap property to specify its width 
                                    or height. But we can't change its color, we cant put anything 
                                    in the lines. They are lines for layout.
                                </p>

                                <p>When we create and size our grid, we create rows and columns.
                                    These is known as tracks. We have rows tracks and columns
                                    tracks and we usually create and size these tracks using 
                                    grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns[grid-template]
                                    for shortcut.

                                <p>Cells is being created within the intersection of tracks. Which 
                                    is a small unit also known as grid cells. They are the smallest 
                                    unit in a grid and can be of different sizes. So one can be wider 
                                    than the other that is to occupy more columns, while other can have 
                                    height than the other, which means to occupy more rows. We can 
                                    use multiple cells to create a grid items. So we can either position
                                    our grid cell horizontally or vertically across grid cells

                            display: grid; <br>
                            gap: 3rem; <br>
                            grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr; <br>
                            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1.5fr; <br>
                            } <br>
                            Note: By default, a div is going to span the entire width of the window, 
                            but it'll only occupy as much vertical space as there is content. Hence,
                            the reason why we set height viewport height to 100, then it's also going 
                            to take that container and make it stretch all the way down to the bottom 
                            of the window. So the above code, we already known we create tracks using 
                            both grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns. So we created 3 columns 
                            with two of them being equal in width while the third one is a bit wider 
                            and we created two rows of equal height. So now, we've got tracks, lines 
                            and also container. Now the items will be place in by default. It'll start 
                            from the first and it'll go into each of the cells that are available. We 
                            can use Flexbox to target grid items to position them.

                                    .cowboy {
                                        background: gold;
                                        grid-column: span 2;
                                    }
                                </li>
                                <p>This increase the width of the cowboy by spreading in width length
                                    from column one to two. We can use the chrome dev tools to inspect.
                                    We'll be able to see the lines and the tracks in our grid. So span 
                                    of two makes our cowboy div go from track one to track 3 range[1-3]
                                    which makes span two to be the bridge between column 1 and column 3.
                                    grid-column is the short form of 'grid-column-start' and grid-column-end.
                                    For example: grid-column-start: 2; grid-column-end: 4; This simply 
                                    means that position start from column 2 and end at column 4. We can 
                                    also use negative value to specify the last column on a grid. So the 
                                    last one is -1. We have -1, -2, -3 and so on... Also, we can start 
                                    and end at whichever direction we want. eg: grid-column-start: 4; 
                                    grid-column-end: 2; This will be flip and still still start at 
                                    column 2 and ends at column 4. Also, we can even for example: 
                                    grid-column-start: span 2; grid-column-end: auto; So the auto is 
                                    the automatically the initial position of our div before we did any 
                                    positioning which is the first line in our case.
                                </p>
                                <p>There is also a corresponding property known as 'grid-row' which is also 
                                    short form of 'grid-row-start' and 'grid-row-end'. Which is use to cover 
                                    vertical cells our grid want to span.

                                <p>Natural position of the astronaut div is beside cowboy. To change 
                                    that position to be the last and under cowboy instead, we use 
                                    order property to set it to 1. Default order is 0. So we increase 
                                    the order of the astronaut.

                                <p>With this being explicit, we simply navigate to pinpoint the

                                    start, then row for it to end and to which column to end.

                            Grid let us overlay items onto other items. So we can

                        <p>The '80' number in book color represent transparency rate. In Hex 
                            code, the first six character correspond to the color so the amount
                            of red, green, and blue. Then we can add a value known as 'alpha'
                            which denote how much transparency there is. 80 is about 50% of 
                            transparency that allows us to see through the orange and the blue
                            and the green. So the book coordinate is also set to overlap, starting 
                            from row one, column two then end at row three and column four.
